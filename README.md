# Hoarder's Corner

## Good news, everyone!

Welcome to the Group 5 Project. I've initialized to the project so that as we decide on concepts we would like to implement we have a boilerplate to begin with. Below is a list of tasks I've completed;

- initialized a repository on github
- Deployed application to Heroku and connected an Mongodb via Atlas. This will help us to test the application with every deployment.
- Implemented a simple vite application
- Implemented a simple server to use express and Apolloclient
- Implement core jwt authenticaion
  - User model
  - Resolvers and typeDefs to interact with the model
  - A simple wireframe log in page
  - Mutation utils to interact with the db

## Dev

`npm i` will run a script that will install all packages needed.

`npm run dev` will run the application in test mode.

`npm run seed` will run seeding data for users.
